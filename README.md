This repository showcases a number of projects that I have completed to highlight relevant skills in data analysis and visualization.


The EDA and Model Building Project was completed alongside another student during my final undergraduate statistics course. Using the LendingClub dataset, we performed exploratory data analysis to determine relevant variables, find correlations and distributions, and gain a better understanding of the data. We preprocessed the data, then fit a number of models to find the most accurate way to predict who is most likely to pay back their loan. These models included logistic regression, decisions trees, bagging and boosting, and neural networks, among others. Due to the large size of the dataset, we ran into issues with training the models on our local machines, which resulted in us only being able to include about 1% of the data during the model fitting stage. This likely reduced the accuracy of the models, but we still obtained interesting results and gained further knowledge of predictive modeling during this project.
